 Are basically ES6 classes

 Properties(props)-- -> Javascript Funtion-- -> HTML(JSX)
 Can also maintain pvt internal state.Maintain some information which is private to that component and uses it for describing it.

 import React, { Component } from 'react'

 class Welcome extends Component {
     render() {
         return <h1>Class Component < /h1>
     }
}

 export default Welcome

 It is not normal HTML it is jsx
