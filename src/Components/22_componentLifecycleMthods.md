:We have seen so far that React web apps are actually a collection of independent components that run according to the interactions made with them. Every React Component has a lifecycle of its own, lifecycle of a component can be defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the componentâ€™s existence. The definition is pretty straightforward but what do we mean by different stages? A React Component can go through four stages of its life as follows. 

//Classification of methods

Mounting:When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
: constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render and componentDidMount

Updating:When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
: static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate

Unmouting:When a component is being removed from the DOM
:componentWillUnmount

Error Handler:When there is an error during rendering, in a 
lifecycel method, or in the constructor of any child component
: static getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch
